# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Joseelmax-00

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a Software Developer and Computer Engineering student from Uruguay. Been working in Python since 2019 
(see how I don't have to update my years of experience anymore?) and have previous experience on API integration, 
web automation, database management and app development in general. 

ðŸ“š I'm interested in all things programming, cryptocurrency, and psychology. I'm also a gamer! 

ðŸ’» Not my resume, I know, but here's my copypaste of relevant skills:
- Python
- Databases (MySQL, Postgres, SQLite and can adapt to others)
- I know data analysis and extraction tools (Selenium, BS4, extract data from any format to any other)
- API Integrations (think 10+ providers updating a database minute to minute, I recieve and unify this data to a single format, process and generate missing data, etc.)
- Have done image processing briefly
- Django, webapps and web projects, from setup to deployment
- Web development (HTML, CSS, Javascript)
- I have many other computer skills, I'm decent with image manipulation, good with Excel or Google spreadsheets, can create SVGs and web graphic design in general with Figma.
- Decent linux experience
